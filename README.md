Reliable Block
=========
Valheim mod that makes blocking more logical.


How does it work?
--------
In vanilla Valheim there are 2 situations in which your block/parry is completely ignored:
1) When you don't have enough stamina
2) When the damage exceeds your block armor and the exceeding damage fills your stagger treshold

This mod simply removes the latter check. When you block/parry, it will always count as long as you have stamina.

Why?
--------
Because blocking should always work if you have shield up in time. That stagger treshold check is the reason why you sometimes can parry 2-star fuling with no problem and next day they randomly one-hit you to oblivion. Now when you get hit really hard, you still get staggered and take heavy damage but you might just survive.

Development
--------
Reference dll's are not included in the repo, you need to copy them from your valheim game library to project's /libs folder.
